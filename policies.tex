\section{Elections} 
The elected positions will be elected in the order specified in the Constitution. For each position, all candidates will have a chance to state their platform and answer questions.

A majority of the vote is needed to elect. Candidates will be called back and told the results. This process is repeated for other positions. \\
When the club gets to electing Members at Large, some number may need to be students according to the constitution. The club will elect the student Members at Large first, with each club member getting to vote for a number of candidates up to the number of Member at Large positions that must be students. After these positions are filled, remaining Member at Large positions are open to any candidates. These positions are filled by the same voting procedure.
