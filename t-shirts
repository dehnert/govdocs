Tech Squares T-shirts
by Linda Resnick
as of March 6, 2000

We order Tech Squares t-shirts from Body Toppers. Inc., 407R Mystic Avenue, 
Medford, MA 02155.  Their phone number is 781-395-3616 x3 or 1-800-445-7021. 
  Fax 781-395-1862.

Directions (off the top of my head): from Rt 38 East, soon after Rt 16, turn 
Right on Hicks Avenue (after MVP Sports & Russo Marine), then first Left 
near a sign for Groceries to Go.  It's an industrial complex, not a true 
street.  They are Unit #13.

I selected them because they were the cheapest, by far, of the 6-8 places I 
researched.  I placed our first order in 8/97.

Minimum order is 12 shirts.  They normally handle large company orders, 
meaning hundreds or thousands of shirts. They don't have specific rules for 
orders as small as ours, but they requested that for small orders, we not 
get too fancy, meaning not more than 2 colors for that few shirts.  The 
number of sizes doesn't matter.  We should order at least 20 shirts before 
we request 3 colors.

All orders should reference our original order # 022537, so they know our 
design.  We paid an initial set-up charge, so we shouldn't lose track of 
this.

I picked the colors we get (navy, maroon, & black) because I thought they'd 
be popular.  Someone can go to the store & look at the other colors if they 
want a change.  The basic shirt costs $6.15.  XXL is an extra dollar.  We 
charge people $10 per shirt, with an extra dollar for XXL.

We must specify 100% cotton.  Orders must be mailed or faxed.  I haven't 
researched this, but maybe we can do it online now.

We have more than recouped our initial investment.  We are currently running 
a profit of about $200, more than enough to cover the cost of our next 
order, including buying a small excess supply to keep in the locker.

To help determine which excess shirts to buy, I suggest we keep track of 
what people have purchased in the past.   As of our fourth order, in 3/99, 
we have ordered the following shirts:

Maroon: 3 S, 3 M, 16 L, 14 XL, 3 XXL
Black: 0 S, 5 M, 11 L, 9 XL, 4 XXL
Navy: 1 S, 1 M, 9 L, 5 XL, 4 XXL
for a total of 88 shirts.

There are almost none left in the locker or waiting to be ordered, so this 
is a fair representation of what people want to purchase.

With the last order, on special request, I ordered one long-sleeved shirt.  
It cost $9.50, and I charged $12.  These only come in black, red, royal, 
navy, ash, & gray.  In the interest of keeping things simple, I recommend we 
not regularly offer them.
